# Fix for npm build Error 126

Error 126 means the command cannot execute. Here are specific fixes for the npm build error:

## Quick Solutions:

1. **Fix script permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod -R +x ./node_modules/.bin
   ```

2. **Run the build script directly with node**:
   ```bash
   node ./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts build
   # or whatever build tool you're using
   ```

3. **Check npm executable permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x $(which npm)
   ```

4. **Use npx instead**:
   ```bash
   npx react-scripts build
   ```

5. **On Windows, try running in cmd.exe instead of other terminals**

6. **Update npm and node**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g npm
   ```

7. **Check for any custom build scripts in your package.json** that might have permission issues
```

If the issue continues, please share your package.json to identify what the build script is trying to run.
